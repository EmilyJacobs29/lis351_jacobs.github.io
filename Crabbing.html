    <p style="margin:30px 150px 100px 0;">There are many ways to catch crabs, but baited box cages will allow you to catch many crabs at the same time. To perform this type of crabbing you will need a box cage, bin, and some form of bait. This bait could be chicken, fish, or really any type of meat. You begin by opening up the flap at the top of the cage and placing the bait in the center column of the cage. Then close the flap and make sure you have a rope attached securely to the top of the cage (but not on the center column flap). Tie that same rope to a secure structure like a post of a dock. Then once this is done the trap can be tossed in the bay and left there for hours while waiting for the crabs to enter the trap. After those hours grab the rope and pull up the trap. To get the crabs out open up the larger flap on the cage. You can then shake the cage upside down over a bin and have the crabs fall into the bin or you can try to pull the crabs out of the cage if they are hanging on (but be very careful).</p>

    <p style="margin:30px 0 100px 150px;">Another type of crabbing is baited line crabbing. This type of crabbing will only allow you to catch about one crab at a time, but requires less equipment than the cage crabbing. All you will need for this crabbing is a rope, bait, bin, and a net. To begin, take the rope and tie it securely around your bait. Then tie the other end of the rope to a secure structure and throw the bait in. You will then have to monitor this bait more than the cage and pull up the line every few minutes (around 10-20 minutes) to check if a crab is on the bait. If a crab is on the bait, continue to hold the rope so that the bait and crab is just below the surface with one hand and hold the net with the other hand. Then take the net and scoop up the crab (and bait if need be) and then put the crab in the bin or pot. This process can also be done with 2 people (one holding the rope and one holding the net). Once the crab is removed from the bait (or if there never was one on in the first place) then you can toss the line back into the bay and repeat until the bait is gone.</p>

    <h5>Net</h5>

    <p style="margin:100px 150px 200px 0;">This type of crabbing is another version that can only catch about one crab at a time. This type requires even less equipment than the past two types of crabbing, but is a more "on the spot" type of crabbing. This type of crabbing only requires a net and bin. To do this type of crabbing you are usually on a dock and are holding your net. Then while on the dock, if you see a crab sitting on one of the dock's posts, take your net and scoop up the crab and put the crab in the bin. Then you're done!</p>

    <h6>When to Release</h6>

    <p style="margin:30px 0 100px 150px;">When crabbing you cannot choose which gender of crabs you catch so you must check after you catch them. The female crabs are released so that they can continue to repopulate the bay. There is one distinctive way to tell the difference between male and female crabs. When looking at the breast plate of the crabs you can see a different pattern depending on the gender. The male crabs have a more long and skinny peak in the middle of the breast plate while the females have a wider peak. People from Maryland like to compare the male peak to the Washington Monument and the female peak to the Capitol.</p>
