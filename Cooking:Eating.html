    <h3>Boling the Crabs</h3>

    <p>Begin by filling a big pot with water and bringing it to a boil. Add some salt and Old Bay to the water so that the crabs can have some extra flavor infused into them. Then, add the crabs quickly one by one to the water and let them cook for about 10-15 minutes (or until they all float to the top of the water). Once all of them are done, take them out of the water with tongs and you're done.</p>

    <h4>How to Clean and Eat a Crab</h4>

    <p>Start by pulling the peak on the breast plate down and breaking it off. Then put both thumbs in between the breast plate and hard shell and pull apart to separate the two. Then use your hands, paper towels, utensils, or anything you want to clean out the gills and guts. Once you are done cleaning it, grab each side of legs with your hands and crack it in half to split the sides apart. Next, pull each leg out of the main clump except the fin tail. Then break the legs into smaller sections by bending the legs at the joints until they separate. Finally, use mallets and crackers to break the shells so that you can then pull the meat out. Throw the shells out and you are left with the soft meat to eat.</p>

    <h5>Best Seasonings and Dipping Sauces</h5>
    
    <p>Crab meat can be eaten with many different combinations of seasonings and dipping sauces. The most common ones are Old Bay, melted butter, and vinegar. You can dip the crab meat in one of these only and eat it or try out different combinations of the three. My personal favorite combination is butter and Old Bay, but everyone loves different combinations the best. However, Old Bay is usually a part of any combination for a Maryland person!</p>
