    <h2><u>Maryland Blue Crabs</u></h2>
    <h3>Spawning</h3>

    <p>The cycle begins when female crabs move to saltier areas of the Chesapeake Bay after mating with a male crab. They move to these areas because crab eggs can only survive on water with a salinity of 18 parts per thousand or above and crab larvae can only survive in salinities of 30 parts per thousand or above. Once the female crab reaches these waters she fertilizes and develops more than a million eggs.</p>

    <h4>Larvae</h4>

    <p>The eggs then hatch and the larvae are brought to the Atlantic Ocean by currents. Then as the larvae grow they begin to crawl along the sea floor until they reach the bay. The crabs will then continue to grow and molt until they reach full maturity after about 18 months.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> <b> Zoea </b> (first larval stage that begins from when the crabs hatch)</li>
      <li> <b> Megalops </b> (second larval stage that begins after about 31-49 days)</li>
      <li> <b> Juvenile Crab </b> (first crab stage that begins about 20 after the megalop stage)</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Adulthood</h5>

    <p>The male crabs will continue to molt throughout their entire lives, but the females go though a different process. Once the female crabs reach full maturity they go through one final molt and then mate with a male crab while she is still in her soft shell phase and continue the cycle.</p>
