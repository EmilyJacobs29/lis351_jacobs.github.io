    <h3>What Are Maryland Blue Crabs?</h3>
    
    <p>Maryland Blue Crabs are typically found in the Chesapeake Bay. These crabs can be identified by the unique blue color seen on their claws. Along with their claws, they have eight legs with the back two being paddle-like fins to help them swim. These crabs are commonly found in underwater grass beds because they provide them with food, shelter, and protection. They are scavengers and will eat almost anything whether it's seaweed, mussels, decaying matter, or anything else they can find. If you are looking for these crabs, it's best to do it during mid-summer to early fall because these crabs tend to burrow at the bottom of the bay during the colder months. </p>
